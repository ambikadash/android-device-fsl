These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 14.04LTS.
Android builds require a 64-bit install.  You should read through all the
material at https://source.android.com/source/building.html (and everything
at https://source.android.com/source/ if you can). At least 6 GB RAM is required for 
building Android using JACK server.


1. Install all the tools as described for your system at
   https://source.android.com/source/building.html

2. Install all the AOSP sources as described at
   https://source.android.com/source/building.html and in the Freescale document
   Android_User's_Guide.pdf Chapter 3.  

3. Install the UIB sources.  I currently maintain three github repositories
   for the linux kernel, uboot, and Android modifications for the UIB.  Assuming
   $ANDROID is the location of your Android source tree:

# in kernel_imx
cd $ANDROID/kernel_imx
cat <<EOF >> .git/config
[remote "apdash"]
    url = https://github.com/ambikadash/linux-fqt.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/apdash/*
[branch "mm6.0.1_1.0.0-ga_uib"]
    remote = apdash
    merge = refs/heads/mm6.0.1_1.0.0-ga_uib
EOF
git pull apdash
git checkout mm6.0.1_1.0.0-ga_uib

# in bootable/bootloader/uboot-imx
cd $ANDROID/bootable/bootloader/uboot-imx
cat <<EOF >> .git/config
[remote "apdash"]
        url = https://github.com/ambikadash/uboot-imx-fqt.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/apdash/*
[branch "mm6.0.1_1.0.0-ga_uib"]
        remote = apdash
        merge = refs/heads/mm6.0.1_1.0.0-ga_uib
EOF
git pull apdash
git checkout mm6.0.1_1.0.0-ga_uib

# in device/fsl
cd $ANDROID/device/fsl
cat <<EOF >> .git/config
[remote "apdash"]
        url = https://github.com/ambikadash/android-device-fsl.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/apdash/*
[branch "imx_M6.0.1_1.0.0_uib"]
	remote = apdash
	merge = refs/heads/imx_M6.0.1_1.0.0_uib
EOF
git pull apdash
git checkout imx_M6.0.1_1.0.0_uib

4. Run the "envsetup.sh" script in build to set up the Android build environment
   variables:

 . build/envsetup.sh

   (Note the syntax: a period followed by a space and the script.)

5. Run the "lunch" command to select the sabresd_6dq-eng target.

 lunch sabresd_6dq-eng

6. Build (note: set -jN where N == the number of cores on your CPU):

 make -j4

7. Android system customizations should go into device/fsl/imx6/imx6.mk,
   device/fsl/imx6/sabresd_6dq.mk, or the files in device/fsl/sabresd_6dq/.  New apps
   should be added to PRODUCT_PACKAGES and new files (e.g., the boot animation)
   added to PRODUCT_COPY_FILES.  Any time a package is added, renamed, or
   removed, a "make installclean" should be performed to remove the disk image
   files and packages from previous builds before creating a new build.

8. Build images are placed in the out/target/product/sabresd_6dq directory.
   The UIB uboot binary for the DualLite is u-boot.imx. 

9. To Flash the UIB using the kitkat emmc-writer, convert the system.img to raw image using
   simg2img utility located at out/host/linux-x86/bin/simg2img. Use boot-imx6dl.img and recovery-imx6dl.img
